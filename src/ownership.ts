// The gap this closes: removing a teammate was guarded only by "the last
// member stays", so any member could delete any other — including the person
// who created the account, kept the workspaces and pays the bill. An invite is
// the cheapest thing on the platform to hand out, which made it the sharpest
// edge in it.
//
// The rules live here, in core, rather than beside the users file in the web
// server, for one reason: the web server's modules import through a bundler
// alias and cannot be loaded by a test runner. A security rule that cannot be
// unit-tested is a security rule that will be quietly broken by a refactor.
// The store stays where it is; only the decision moved.
//
// Deliberately a boolean, not a role table. Two states — owns it, or does not
// — is the whole of what has been decided, and a permission matrix would be
// inventing distinctions nobody has asked for and would be far harder to take
// back than to add later.
