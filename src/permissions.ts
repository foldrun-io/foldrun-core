// Who may do what, in one table.
//
// Ownership (ownership.ts) answered one question — who owns the account — and
// gated one act with it: removing a member. Everything else was open to every
// member and every API key: writing secrets, deploying, approving a run,
// spending the wallet. Fine for one person; wrong the day a second one is
// invited, and wrong in the specific way that the person approving a run and
// the person who asked for approval were the same role.
//
// Four roles, ordered, and a list of actions each with the least role that
// may do it. The API asks `can(role, action)` at one chokepoint per route and
// the dashboard asks the same function to decide which controls to draw, so
// the two cannot disagree. Rules about changing roles live here too, for the
// reason ownership.ts gave: a security rule that cannot be unit-tested is one
// a refactor breaks quietly, and web/server cannot be loaded by a test runner.
//
// What a member without a role means is the one deliberate compromise. Every
// account that exists was built when all members were equal, so an unmarked
// member reads as `admin` — the power they had — rather than being demoted by
// a deploy. New invites carry a role; the owner can lower anyone's.
