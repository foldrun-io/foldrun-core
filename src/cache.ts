// Redis: only what can be rebuilt.
//
// The test for whether something belongs here (docs/paas-adr.md): if Redis is
// wiped, the platform gets slower and re-elects a worker, and loses no
// customer data. Rate-limit counters, leases, SSE fan-out, hot caches — yes.
// Runs, money, identity — never; those are Postgres, and the queue stays in
// the same database as the run records so a claim and a status write are one
// transaction. Adding Redis does not reopen that.
//
// OPTIONAL, like the database. With no FOLDRUN_REDIS_URL every function here
// degrades to a safe local answer rather than throwing — a laptop install has
// no Redis and must still refuse a brute-force attempt.
