// It is a sanitised copy of the first real pipeline built on this platform
// (NSW conveyancer leads): extract → enrich in parallel with verify → an
// approval gate → upload. Every step is real — real agents, a real script
// tool, a real gate — and nothing external: the "CRM" is a script that
// validates and reports instead of POSTing, the source list is a knowledge
// file, and the whole run costs cents. Watching it teaches the grammar
// faster than any page describing it.

This workspace is safe to play in: the crm-upload tool here only VALIDATES
and reports — it never sends anything anywhere. The budget: line caps the
month at $5 so experiments cannot run away.

Delete this workspace freely; the "New workspace → demo" button recreates it.

The demo's stand-in for a real CRM importer. Same shape as the real thing —
parse, dedupe by email, summarise — with the network call replaced by a
report. Copy this file and add the fetch to make it real.
