// The signup form must not say which addresses are registered.
//
// It did, and worst of all with signups CLOSED — the default, and what the
// production box runs. A registered email answered "an account with that
// email already exists"; an unknown one answered "signups are closed on this
// install". Two different sentences from a door that is shut either way, so
// anyone could work through a list and learn which addresses were customers
// without ever being able to sign up.
//
// The order of the gates is the whole fix, which is why it lives in core
// rather than beside the users file: web/server imports through a bundler
// alias and cannot be loaded here.
